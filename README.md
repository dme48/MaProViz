# Ma(ting)Pro(blem)Viz(ualization)
The mating problem vizualization is a program designed to solve and represent the classical algorithm to solve the Mating Problem. Currently a skeleton with the basic classes and functionality is being built, so neither the "solving the problem" nor the "representing the states of the algorithm" ends are covered.
